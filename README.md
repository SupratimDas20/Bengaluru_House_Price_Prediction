# Bangalore House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using a dataset containing 13,321 entries and 9 features. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, the project aims to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce forecasting errors in real estate price estimation

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: The dataset comprises 13,321 entries with 9 features, providing the necessary information to build and evaluate predictive models.
- **Predictive Models**: Implemented multiple machine learning models including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.
- **Performance Improvements**: Achieved a 25% increase in predictive accuracy and a 30% reduction in forecasting errors in quarterly financial projections.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Includes the implementation of linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, feature engineering, and model development processes.
